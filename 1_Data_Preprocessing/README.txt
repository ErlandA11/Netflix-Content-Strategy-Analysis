# Data Preprocessing - Netflix Content Strategy Analysis

## Introduction
In this step, we focus on cleaning and preprocessing the "Hours Viewed" column to ensure the dataset is ready for further analysis. Proper data preprocessing is crucial as it helps in eliminating inconsistencies and prepares the data for meaningful insights.

## Steps in Data Preprocessing

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**
   - Load essential Python libraries such as pandas and numpy to handle data efficiently.

2. **Loading the Dataset**
   - Read the Netflix dataset using pandas and inspect the structure to identify missing or inconsistent values.

3. **Cleaning the "Hours Viewed" Column**
   - Convert the "Hours Viewed" column to a numeric format to ensure consistency.
   - Handle missing or incorrect values by imputing or removing them as necessary.

4. **Checking for Duplicates**
   - Identify and remove any duplicate rows that may exist in the dataset to maintain data integrity.

5. **Standardizing Data Formats**
   - Ensure date formats are consistent across the dataset.
   - Normalize categorical data where required.

6. **Saving the Processed Data**
   - Store the cleaned and preprocessed dataset for further analysis in subsequent steps.

## Expected Outcome
- A structured dataset ready for exploratory data analysis and insights extraction.
- Improved data quality, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the next phases of the analysis.

This preprocessing step sets the foundation for identifying patterns in Netflix's content strategy, including trends in viewership, content type performance, and seasonal influences.
